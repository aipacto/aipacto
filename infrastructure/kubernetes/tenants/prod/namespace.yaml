    # This is the most important label. It tells Kubernetes to BLOCK any pods
    # that do not meet the 'baseline' security profile. This is a great starting
    # point for production workloads. Your current app charts already meet this standard.

    # (Optional but Recommended) These labels provide warnings for pods that
    # would violate the policy, without blocking them. It's useful for testing
    # new workloads or preparing to move to a stricter standard like 'restricted'.

    # (Optional but Recommended) This creates audit log entries for any violations,
    # which is excellent for security monitoring.
